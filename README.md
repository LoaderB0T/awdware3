# awdware3

awdware3 is the third iteration of my personal website (work in progress). This time it is more of a portfolio than the last two times.

## Motivation 💥

**awdware3** is both a portfolio to show the world what I am doing and a playground for myself to learn new technologies like Module Federation.

And it is live: [awdware.de](https://awdware.de)!

## Tech-Stack 🔥

✅ Angular 13

✅ Nx Monorepo

✅ Module Federation

✅ [ng-dynamic-mf](https://github.com/LoaderB0T/ng-dynamic-mf) for fully dynamic modules

## Contributing 🧑🏻‍💻

As this is my personal portfolio, I don't expect nor accept any PRs. Feedback is very welcome of course!
